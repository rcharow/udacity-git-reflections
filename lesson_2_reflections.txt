What happens with you initialize a git repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a git repository, git creates a git directory in your repository directory.
You need to do this to track the files in the repo.

How is the staging area different from the staging area and repo? What value does it offer?
The staging area keeps track of files that are going to be committed.
It allows you to choose certain files from the repo to commit.
This means that you don't have to commit all of the files in your repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use git diff to compare the files in your working directory to the files
in the staging area before you commit.
